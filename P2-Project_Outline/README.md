## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Application where home cooks, people who love cooking, share their recipes, ideas and cooking experiences. This can be an inspiration to others.

Many authentic recipes from many regions are not being made in recent times and are not heard by people outside their community. Through this application people around the world can know and taste the authentic recipes. 

This idea was a thought process of mine. I was thinking how my grandmothers and great grandmothers were cooking and what will their recipes be like. If it was recorded it could have been useful for the present generation to follow their healthy living. 

### Features
1. User Log in and Single sign-on: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
2. Search: Users will be able to search for recipes containing given text.
3. Create Post: Users will be able to create new recipes when logged in. New posts will appear in the userâ€™s profile.
4. Location of the recipe from: User can see throuh Google Maps, from where the recipe orginated.
5. Search with specifics: User can search through the recipes with the ingredients in hand.

### Technologies
1. Java
2. Spring Security OAuth 
3. Spring Boot
4. Thymeleaf templates
5. Hibernate
6. MySQL/ NoSQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
As of now technology Spring Security OAuth is to be learned. Also I am thinking there will be problem if I use MySQL. If I can't use MySQL I have to learn NoSQL(Couchbase/Mongo DB) and have to analyze about Azure. Need to research about Google Maps, to check if REST api is needed.
